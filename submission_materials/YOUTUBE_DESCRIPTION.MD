Diagnosing respiratory disease shouldn't rely on guesswork. "The Lung Listener" is an AI-powered research instrument that turns subjective lung sounds into objective, actionable data. Built in just 5 days using the Google DeepMind "Vibe Coding" workflow in AI Studio.

**About the Project:**
Respiratory disease is the 3rd leading cause of death worldwide, yet diagnosis often relies on the subjective human ear. This tool uses **Gemini 3 Pro’s native multimodal audio capabilities** to:
1.  **Visualize** raw clinical audio with real-time spectrograms.
2.  **Analyze** pathology (wheezes/crackles) with millisecond precision, correcting messy human labels.
3.  **Isolate** the signal by generating custom Python filters to remove noise instantly.

**Tech Stack:**
* **Model:** Gemini 3 Pro Preview (`gemini-3-pro-preview`)
* **Platform:** Google AI Studio
* **Frontend:** React, Tailwind, WaveSurfer.js
* **Data:** ICBHI Respiratory Sound Database

**Submitted for the Google DeepMind "Vibe Code" Hackathon 2025.**

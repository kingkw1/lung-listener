**Key Strategy Notes for this Script:**

  * **The "Vibe" Hook:** It explicitly shows the *creation* process in AI Studio early on (0:20) to prove you followed the "Vibe Coding" theme.
  * **The "Science" Pivot:** It leans into the "messy labels" problem we discussed. Instead of hiding the broad labels, we frame them as the *problem* that Gemini solves.
  * **Judge Bait:**
      * **Amit:** We explicitly say "Native Audio Reasoning" (no text transcription).
      * **Joana:** We frame this as a tool for "Telehealth" and "Clinical decision support."
      * **Paige:** We emphasize the "Explainability" of the spectrogram and the ground truth overlay.

### Part 1: The Hook - "The Deaf Spot in Telehealth" (0:00 - 0:25)

**Overall Vibe:** Urgent, cinematic, and authoritative. The music should be tense but driving.

* **Shot 1: Title Card**
    * **Timecode:** 0:00 - 0:03
    * **Visuals:** A minimalist, "Clinical Dark Mode" title card. Project Logo, the title **"The Lung Listener,"** and the subtitle "Vibe Code with Gemini 3 Pro".
    * **Editing:** Fade in from black. Glitch transition out.
    * **Audio:** Deep, rhythmic bass pulse. "Bio-digital" startup sound.
    * **VO:** *(No voiceover)*

* **Shot 2: The Clinical Context**
    * **Timecode:** 0:03 - 0:12
    * **Visuals:** **Graphic.** A dark, high-contrast medical illustration of human lungs.
        * (0:03-0:07): Text overlay appears: **"3rd Leading Cause of Death."**
        * (0:07-0:12): The image flickers/glitches. Text changes to a warning color (Amber/Red): **"Current Diagnosis: SUBJECTIVE."**
    * **Editing:** Slow zoom in on the lungs. The "glitch" effect syncs with the word "Subjective."
    * **Audio:** Music stays low and serious.
    * **VO:** "Respiratory disease is the third leading cause of death worldwide. But diagnosing it relies on something incredibly subjective: the human ear."

* **Shot 3: The Problem Visualization**
    * **Timecode:** 0:12 - 0:25
    * **Visuals:** Screen recording of a standard audio player. A mouse cursor hovers uncertainly over a waveform. Fade to black with text overlay: *"We need a Research Instrument."*
    * **Editing:** Slow motion on the mouse movement. Hard cut to black.
    * **Audio:** Subtle "heartbeat" SFX underneath.
    * **VO:** "Doctors hear a 'crackle,' but they can't isolate it from the noise. Telehealth is deaf to these subtle signals. We need to turn a fleeting sound into hard evidence."

### Part 2: The "Vibe Build" & Setup (0:25 - 0:40)

**Overall Vibe:** High-energy, tech-forward. Proves you used AI Studio and shows off the new "One Click" workflow.

* **Shot 4: The AI Studio Montage**
    * **Timecode:** 0:25 - 0:33
    * **Visuals:** **(CRITICAL CAPTURE)** Screen record yourself typing the "Clinical Dark Mode" prompt into AI Studio. **Key Moment:** Click "Run/Preview" and show the UI *popping* into existence in the right pane.
    * **Editing:** Speed ramps (4x). Flash cuts on the UI updates.
    * **Audio:** Mechanical typing sounds. Tempo increases.
    * **VO:** "Enter **The Lung Listener**. Built in just days using the **Gemini 3 Pro Vibe Coding** workflow. I didn't just write code; I prompted a 'Clinical Research Station' into existence."

* **Shot 5: The "One-Click" Load (New Feature)**
    * **Timecode:** 0:33 - 0:40
    * **Visuals:** Close up on the new Sidebar. Mouse clicks **"Case 1: Pneumonia"**. The audio, metadata (Patient 218), and swimlane labels load instantly.
    * **Editing:** Match cut from the code to the live app.
    * **Audio:** "Sci-Fi Power Up" SFX when the dashboard populates.
    * **VO:** "It’s a signal processing lab. We instantly ingest raw clinical audio alongside the standard doctor annotations."

---

### Part 3: The "Ground Truth" Reality (0:40 - 0:55)

**Overall Vibe:** Analytical and revealing. Highlighting the "Messy Data" problem.

* **Shot 6: The Messy Labels (Swimlanes)**
    * **Timecode:** 0:40 - 0:55
    * **Visuals:** Mouse hovers over the **Yellow Swimlane Bars** (Human Labels). Show how wide/imprecise they are compared to the spectrogram heat map. Text overlay: *"3.5 Seconds labeled..."*
    * **Editing:** Desaturate the video slightly to indicate "the problem."
    * **Audio:** Music dips slightly.
    * **VO:** "But visualizing that data reveals a fatal flaw. Look at the yellow labels. They smear a single crackle across multiple breath cycles. It's messy and imprecise."

---

### Part 4: The Gemini Brain - Native Multimodality (0:55 - 1:25)

**Overall Vibe:** Triumphant. The "Technical Depth" proof.

* **Shot 7: Deep Analysis Activation**
    * **Timecode:** 0:55 - 1:10
    * **Visuals:** Click **"Run Deep Analysis."** Show the status text changing: *"Gemini 3 Pro is reasoning..."* -> Text streams in. **Overlay:** Briefly flash the code snippet: `model: "gemini-3-pro-preview"`.
    * **Editing:** Digital highlighter effect on the code snippet.
    * **Audio:** "Data Processing" hum. High-tech beeps.
    * **VO:** "To find the true signal inside that noise, we pipe the raw audio buffer directly into Gemini 3 Pro."

* **Shot 8: The Precision Proof**
    * **Timecode:** 1:10 - 1:25
    * **Visuals:** The **Purple AI Bars** appear on the bottom track. Zoom in (using the new Zoom buttons) to show the precise Purple Bar (0.5s) sitting inside the broad Yellow Bar (3.0s).
    * **Editing:** Split screen or picture-in-picture zoom.
    * **Audio:** Triumphant musical swell.
    * **VO:** "Its native multimodality hears the texture of the sound, refining a fifteen-second smear into a precise two-second diagnostic event."

### Part 5: The Climax - "Hearing the Cure" (1:25 - 1:45)

**Overall Vibe:** The "Wow" Moment. Visceral and undeniable.

* **Shot 9: The Active Filter Comparison**
    * **Timecode:** 1:25 - 1:45
    * **Visuals:**
        1.  Mouse clicks **"Solo Raw"** (Cyan Track). Audio plays (Noisy/Hissing).
        2.  Mouse clicks **"Solo Filtered"** (Green Track). Audio plays (Crystal Clear).
        3.  Briefly show the JSON config: `"type": "highpass", "frequency": 500`.
    * **Editing:** Visual pulse/ripple when the clean audio starts.
    * **Audio:** **(CRITICAL)** Lower the background music. Let the "Hiss -> Clean" transition be loud and clear.
    * **VO:** "But it doesn't just diagnose. Gemini generates a **custom Python filter** to remove the noise. Listen. From this..." *(Sound of static)* "...to this." *(Sound of clear wheeze)*. "We isolate the pathology."

### Part 6: The Outro - Impact (1:45 - 2:00)

**Overall Vibe:** Hopeful, human, and professional.

* **Shot 10: The Second Opinion**
    * **Timecode:** 1:45 - 1:55
    * **Visuals:** Return to the Wireframe Lungs from the intro.
        * Action: Instead of glitching, they are pulsing with a slow, calm, rhythmic "breathing" motion.
        * Color: They transition from Cyan to a warm, confident White/Gold or Bright Green.
        * Overlay: A digital grid or "shield" scans down over them, locking the image in place.
        * Text: Elegant text fades in: "500 Million Lives."
    * **Editing:** Slow, smooth zoom out.
    * **Audio:** The "static" from the intro is gone. Just pure, resonant chords.
    * **VO:** "The Lung Listener isn't just an app. It's a second opinion for the 500 million people suffering from respiratory conditions."

* **Shot 11: End Card**
    * **Timecode:** 1:55 - 2:00
    * **Visuals:** Black background. "The Lung Listener" Logo. "Built with Gemini 3 Pro." Kaggle Logo.
    * **Editing:** Fade to black.
    * **Audio:** Final musical hit.
    * **VO:** "Validated by data. Powered by Gemini. Built to save lives."
